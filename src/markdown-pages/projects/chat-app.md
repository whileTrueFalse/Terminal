### Overview

The project is a simple chat app that allows users to send messages to each other. It uses Flutter and Firebase as the backend for the app. But the main feature was E2EE assignmend and designed by me. I used Double-Rachet and Diffie-Hellman to encrypt messages and keep them private, and to make sure that only the intended recipients can read them. Moreover, 2FA was implemented to make sure that only the owner of the account can access the app and send messages.
