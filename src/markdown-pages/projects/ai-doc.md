AI-DOC is a web app that uses machine learning to analyze and diagnose dieseases based on user input. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading type of diesease or symptoms and analyzing their content. Based on the user input, AI-DOC generates a report that suggests possible dieseases and provides additional information, such as medications, exercises and diet plans.
