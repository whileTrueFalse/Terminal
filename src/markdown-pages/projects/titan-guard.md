The goal of the project was to create a fragment of an anti-virus that would be able to detect a specific type of malware. The main challenge was to create a fragment of the anti-virus that would be able to detect a specific type of malware. Also i've tried to train this antivirus using machine learning, so for specific malware its accuracy is 0.92.
